          "desc": "<p>Throughout the documentation are indications of a section&#39;s\nstability. The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it\nmatures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Some are so\nproven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at\nall. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous\nand in the process of being redesigned.</p>\n<p>The stability indices are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 0 - Deprecated. This feature is known to be problematic, and\nchanges may be planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause\nwarnings to be emitted. Backwards compatibility across major versions should\nnot be expected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- separator -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 1 - Experimental. This feature is still under active development\nand subject to non-backwards compatible changes, or even removal, in any\nfuture version. Use of the feature is not recommended in production\nenvironments. Experimental features are not subject to the Node.js Semantic\nVersioning model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- separator -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 2 - Stable. The API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the\nnpm ecosystem is a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely\nnecessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caution must be used when making use of <code>Experimental</code> features, particularly\nwithin modules that may be used as dependencies (or dependencies of\ndependencies) within a Node.js application. End users may not be aware that\nexperimental features are being used, and therefore may experience unexpected\nfailures or behavior changes when API modifications occur. To help avoid such\nsurprises, <code>Experimental</code> features may require a command-line flag to\nexplicitly enable them, or may cause a process warning to be emitted.\nBy default, such warnings are printed to <a href=\"process.html#process_process_stderr\"><code>stderr</code></a> and may be handled by\nattaching a listener to the <a href=\"process.html#process_event_warning\"><code>&#39;warning&#39;</code></a> event.</p>\n"
